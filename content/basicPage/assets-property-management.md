      ## Pricing


      DeltaQ is offered as a combination of a one-off activation fee and a
      yearly subscription fee.


      We aim to offer DeltaQ service at a payback time less than 1 year for the
      first year (including the one-off activation fee) and less than 6 months
      as from year two.


      To support that aim, we cap the yearly subscription fee to a percentage of
      the actual savings, thereby eliminating any financial risk for you as a
      client. The lower the actual savings, the less you will be charged. *


      \* Conditions subject to project specific characteristics.

      ### Specifications


      Because of their central role in building and occupant data collection,
      building management systems are key in lots of the smart building services
      offered nowadays. With BACnet and other open data communication protocols,
      the world of building automation and control is slowly moving towards
      better connectivity. Despite these initiatives, having a truly open
      building control / BMS still depends largely on the specific
      configuration. With DeltaQ, **we advise you on how to obtain a 100% open
      and future-proof building control / BMS**, allowing you to give access to
      any third party application without the need for additional investments or
      expensive configuration.
