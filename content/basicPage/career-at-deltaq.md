      ## Vacancy Technical Project Manager


      DeltaQ is a Belgian technology company, operating from the centre of
      Brussels, which developed a software solution that learns to predict the
      behaviour of a building (in a context of comfort and energy use) and
      leverages these predictions to automatically and optimally steer the
      energy systems. DeltaQ improves comfort while maximizing energy and CO 2
      savings and allows operational teams to turn their attention to added
      value work as opposed to repetitive tasks and constant fine-tuning. When
      deployed over large volumes of buildings, DeltaQ will deliver an important
      contribution to realizing the worldâ€™s ambition in the fight against
      climate change.
