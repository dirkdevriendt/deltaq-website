          #### Bridge the performance gap


          New buildings are often using a lot more energy in operation than
          expected in the design phase. Badly adjusted controls are an important
          cause for this. DeltaQ helps you bridge this “performance gap” and
          **meet the design objectives.**

          #### Save time and money on configuration


          No need to program a wide variety of building control scenarios.
          DeltaQ optimizes controls continuously by anticipating on variations
          in the circumstances. Furthermore, DeltaQ **opens the building control
          system / BMS for other smart building applications.**
