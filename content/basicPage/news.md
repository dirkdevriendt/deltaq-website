      **With a proven concept, DeltaQ, a Brussels based scale-up focusing on
      reducing energy consumption in commercial buildings, attracted additional
      equity funding to fuel its international impact on CO2 reduction and to
      expand its commercial and operations teams. As from today, new CEO Khadija
      Nadi will lead the company towards achieving these goals and contributing
      significantly to worldwide sustainability targets.** 


      The investment round was led by Impact Capital (holding Piet Colruyt) and
      Aconterra. Thomas Leysen, Elanti and the management also participated in
      the capital increase.


      ## **About our solution**


      DeltaQ has developed and is commercialising a machine learning solution
      that continuously optimizes building controls (heating, cooling,
      ventilation) to reduce energy consumption, CO2-emissions while also
      improving the indoor climate in commercial buildings. DeltaQ typically
      reduces CO2-emissions for its customers with 15% to 40% and can contribute
      significantly to reduce global climate change The company can realize this
      ambitious target without requiring big investments (such as additional
      insulation). Payback times of the solution are limited to a few months.


      DeltaQ’s solution has so many benefits for different stakeholders within a
      building and international sustainability agreements, it can be a real
      gamechanger when it comes to smart solutions in this area. Ron Schuermans
      of Aconterra, is specialized in property technology. He says: 


      _“We consider DeltaQ’s solution as one of the most effective solutions to
      significantly reduce CO2-emissions and increase efficiency in the built
      environment. That is why we have decided to invest in DeltaQ.”_ 


      ## About our company


      Piet Colruyt, founder of Impact Capital, who has seen many start-ups and
      scale ups come and go, says: 


      > _“DeltaQ possesses everything to make a significant impact on global
      climate change: an easy solution, a great track record, and a dedicated
      team”_


      DeltaQ was incorporated in 2019 as a spinoff of the Belgian company 3E, a
      leader in renewable energy solutions, after having been in incubation for
      more than three years. Meanwhile some of the largest asset owners and
      managers in the world use DeltaQ’s solutions. 


      The plan to reach DeltaQ’s ambitions have been developed by the new CEO,
      Khadija Nadi, who was with DeltaQ as director. She is officially appointed
      as CEO immediately following the capital increase.


      Werner Koninckx, chairman of DeltaQ: 


      > _“Khadija has a wealth of experience in strategy, marketing, global
      sales and building businesses. Throughout her career, she has demonstrated
