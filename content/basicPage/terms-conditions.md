      These terms and conditions apply to the delivery of data outputs on this
      website by 3E SA, with registered office at Kalkkaai 6, B-1000 Brussels,
      Belgium, company number 0465.755.594, RJP Brussels.


      By ordering data outputs on this website, you agree to the following terms
      and conditions.


      Subject to payment of the related fee, you are granted a limited
      non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use the ordered data
      outputs.


      Sublicensing or reselling of the data outputs as such is not permitted.
      You may only sublicense or resell the data outputs provided you add
      substantial value to the data outputs (e.g. creation of studies, reports
      or analyses).


      You shall not publish, transmit or communicate any data outputs without
      the prior written consent of 3E. Published or posted analysis based in
      whole or in part on the data outputs must reference 3E as part of the
      final work.


      You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the data outputs
      shall remain the property of 3E and/or its licensors.


      While we strive to provide the most accurate data outputs possible, 3E
      makes no warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the data outputs.
      All the data outputs are provided on an "as is" basis without warranties
      or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without
      limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement,
      quality, or fitness for a particular purpose. There is no right of return
      or refund of delivered data outputs. You assume any risks associated with
      the exercise of the rights granted to you under these terms.


      In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
      negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law,
      shall 3E be liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect,
      special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind arising as a
      result of these terms or out of the use or inability to use the data
      outputs (including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, loss of
      data or loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
      or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 3E has been
      advised of the possibility of such damages.


      You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless 3E, its officers, employees
      and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, damages or
      injuries of any kind and nature arising out of any cause or event which is
      attributable to your use of the data outputs.


      3E may terminate the license granted under these terms if you fail to
      remedy any breach of your obligations under these terms within 30 days of
      notice from 3E, requesting you to remedy such breach.


      These terms and conditions are governed by Belgian law. All disputes
      arising out of or in connection herewith that cannot be resolved by
      amicable settlement within a term of thirty (30) days (which term shall
      however not apply in case of unpaid invoice(s)) from the date that the
      dispute is referred from one party to the other, shall be subject to the
      exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Brussels.
