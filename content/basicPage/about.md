      Natural resources are limited and climate change mitigation imposes clear
      goals on worldwide CO2 emission reduction by 2050. Energy efficiency will
      play a crucial role to meet the short term goals because despite our
      efforts to replace fossil fuels by renewable sources the global emissions
      are still growing.


      A transition is required in all domains and layers of our society, We
      believe this transition is an incentive for radical innovation, the spark
      for positive change. Shifting towards a carbon-free society is an
      opportunity to stimulate our economy as well as to create more social
      equality

      Energy use in buildings is a key contributor to global CO2 emissions. Even
      in new and modern buildings, bad control and operation often increase
      energy use by 20% and more. DeltaQ has developed predictive control
      algorithms that drastically change how buildings operate. Our innovative
      solutions improve thermal comfort for the occupants, create control
      transparency for operators and allow buildings to interact flexibly with
      the grid. We have the knowledge, means and commitment to set new standards
      for building performance.


      It is our ambition to make our technology widely available and contribute
      to the energy transition, with a win-win for all stakeholders. DeltaQ
      wants to make the difference.
