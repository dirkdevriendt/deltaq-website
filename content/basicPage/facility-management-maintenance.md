          and continuously optimize setpoints** to anticipate outdoor
          temperature, solar irradiance, occupant behaviour, etc. This saves you
          precious time and reduces the number of comfort complaints

      ## Pricing


      DeltaQ is offered as a combination of a one-off activation fee and a
      yearly subscription fee.


      We aim to offer DeltaQ service at a payback time less than 1 year for the
      first year (including the one-off activation fee) and less than 6 months
      as from year two.


      To support that aim, we cap the yearly subscription fee to a percentage of
      the actual savings, thereby eliminating any financial risk for you as a
      client. The lower the actual savings, the less you will be charged. *


      \* Conditions subject to project specific characteristics.
