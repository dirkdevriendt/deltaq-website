      # How it works


      ## DeltaQ continuously optimizes your building controls, combining
      forecast data and A.I. to match user needs.

      #### DeltaQ gateway installation


      To gather the building data and apply the DeltaQ control signals, a
      **small-sized communication device** is installed: the DeltaQ Building
      Gateway. Our team coordinates any preparatory work if applicable.
    content2: >-
      #### Start data collection


      The DeltaQ gateway connects to the **building control / BMS network,**
      gathers data and feeds it to the DeltaQ cloud platform. Data transfer to
      the cloud is done via an on-site connection to the internet or via
      cellular connection in case of network restrictions.

      #### Building configuration


      The building is configured by the DeltaQ team with support from the
      building maintenance staff. With every configuration step, more real-time
      **operational monitoring is displayed on the DeltaQ dashboard**.
    content4: >-
      #### Training of staff


      We train the building maintenance staff on the DeltaQ steering and
      dashboard functionalities. Furthermore, we **streamline service and
      intervention procedures** to ensure smooth collaboration.

      #### Self-learning building model


      DeltaQ self-learning algorithms require 4-8 weeks of data to identify and
      calibrate a building model (digital twin of the building). After initial
      model identification, **DeltaQ recalibrates the model on a weekly basis**
      to account for changes in building characteristics, occupation, seasonal
      changes, etc.

      #### Start predictive control


      DeltaQ calculates optimal control signals combining the building model
      with user requirements, weather forecasts, energy price data, etc. The
      **optimal control signals are applied automatically and continuously** to
      the building control / BMS, overruling specific setpoints.

          During night-time DeltaQ will ensure just in time cooling of your
          building which results in an optimal energy consumption and a
          comfortable workplace.

          DeltaQ will steer your heating system to reach the preferred
          temperature for working, just in time. By synchronising with weather
          predictions DeltaQ will optimize energy consumption.

      ## How we make a difference


      ### DeltaQâ€™s self-learning algorithms learn how a building behaves under
      varying internal and weather conditions. DeltaQ will continuously maximize
      energy cost savings while ensuring optimal comfort.
