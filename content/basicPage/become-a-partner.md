      ## Specifications


      Because of their central role in building and occupant data collection,
      building management systems are key in lots of the smart building services
      offered nowadays. With BACnet and other open data communication protocols,
      the world of building automation and control is slowly moving towards
      better connectivity. Despite these initiatives, having a truly open
      building control / BMS still depends largely on the specific
      configuration.


      With DeltaQ, **we advise you on how to obtain a 100% open and future-proof
      building control / BMS**, allowing you to give access to any third party
      application without the need for additional investments or expensive
      configuration.
